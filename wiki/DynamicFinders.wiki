#summary You give us an interface, we give you a DAO.

= Introduction =

A *Dynamic Finder* is a data retrieval *method* on a *concrete class*, annotated with the `@Finder` annotation. Warp Persist will intercept calls to these methods and generate the implementation.

A *Dynamic Accessor* is an *interface* or *abstract class* holding nothing but Dynamic Finders, which can be specified when configuring a !PersistenceService. These need to be specified because Guice does not intercept interfaces or abstract classes. Dynamic Finders on Dynamic Accessors also support `@Transactional`.

Note that the Dynamic Finders feature is currently *not* supported for DB4O.
