#summary What is warp-persist?

== Introduction ==

Most serious applications need to interact in some way with a data store. This may be as simple as a desktop chat program that stores and reads user preferences, or as complex as an enterprise web application dealing with several thousands of transactions to a relational database system.

Warp-persist is a lightweight library that provides the bridge between your application code and the frameworks that drive data persistence. It does for data persistence, what [http://code.google.com/p/google-guice Google Guice] does for your objects and services.

Mostly, it makes working with persistence easy. And safe.
