#summary Overview of warp-persist architecture

= Overview =

Warp-persist is a thin integration layer for accessing and using data persistence engines (such as Hibernate or Oracle TopLink) from inside an application running on Google Guice.


Persistence frameworks can be cumbersome to configure and manage. There are many aspects to manage in your code including everything from concurrency to data transactions. Warp-persist removes most of these problems by bridging the gap between persistence and dependency injection.

We currently support three popular persistence systems out of the box:

  * Hibernate
  * Java Persistence API (JPA)
  * Db4objects (a lightweight object database)

Java Persistence API (JPA) is supported for any compliant vendor implementation including TopLink, Kodo and Hibernate.

Warp-persist also provides the ability to extend and plug in other persistence systems with a few simple configuration changes.
