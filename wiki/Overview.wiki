*Architectural overview of warp-persist applications*


Persistence frameworks can be cumbersome to configure and integrate with your code. Warp-persist removes most of these problems by bridging the gap between data persistence and the dependency injection idiom.

We currently support three popular persistence systems out of the box:

  * Hibernate
  * Java Persistence API (JPA)
  * Db4objects

Warp-persist also provides the ability to extend and plug in any other persistence system with a few simple configuration changes.
